    <h3>WHAT IS CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
    CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
    This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="line">CSS is not neccesarry</span> <span class="mark">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all ata once</li>
        <li class="li4">External Stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - <span class="break">by using style attribute inside HTML elements.</span></li>
        <li>Internal - <span class="break">by using a style element in the head sssection</span>.</li>
        <li>External - <span class="break">by using a link element to link to an external css file.</span></li>
        <li class="break">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to
        try it yourself.</mark></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web
        developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became
        a long and expensive process.</p>
    <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
    
    With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
